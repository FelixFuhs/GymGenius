    # For recommending weight, we often work towards a target rep and RIR.
    # Let's assume a common target of 8-12 reps for hypertrophy, 3-6 for strength.
    # And RIR 1-3.
    # The `calculate_training_params` in learning_models gives these.
    # For this example, let's fix target_reps and target_rir for simplicity of demonstration.
    target_reps_for_recommendation = 8

    # 2. Calculate initial recommended weight based on e1RM, target reps, and target RIR
    # This is effectively reversing the e1RM formula: Weight = e1RM * ( (30 - (Reps + RIR_adj)) / 30 )
    # Or more directly: Weight = e1RM / (1 + ( (Reps + RIR_adj) / 30) )
    # Using the formula from estimate_1rm_with_rir_bias: estimated_1rm = weight / (1 - 0.0333 * total_reps_adjusted_for_rir)
    # So, weight = estimated_1rm * (1 - 0.0333 * total_reps_adjusted_for_rir)

    # Adjust target_rir by user's bias for calculation:
    # If user underestimates RIR (positive bias), they are stronger, so for a *true* RIR 2, they might report RIR 0.
    # Or, if they report RIR 2, their true RIR is 2 + bias.
    # When recommending, we want them to *achieve* a true RIR.
    # So, if we want them to hit true RIR 2, and their bias is +1 (they underestimate by 1),
    # we should tell them to aim for RIR 1 (because 1 - (+1) = 0 in their perception for e1RM calc, but that's for *input*.
    # For *output* recommendation: target effective RIR for calculation = target_reported_RIR - user_rir_bias
    # This is the RIR value the Epley formula expects if it were raw.
