# Extended Epley Formula for 1RM prediction
# Formula: 1RM = w * (1 + (r / 30))
# Some sources use variations, e.g. Brzycki: w / ( 1.0278 â€“ 0.0278 * r )
# We'll stick to the common Epley: w * (1 + r / 30)
# For r=1, 1RM = w. For r=0, it's undefined or implies w is already 1RM.
# We should handle cases where reps are very low (e.g., 1) or too high for reliable prediction.
